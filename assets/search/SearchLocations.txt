in the astral planes
on Mars
on Olympus Mons
on Mount Everest
in a dark alley
underwater
in the Lost City of Atlantis
in high orbit above Jupiter
in the rings of Saturn
in low orbit around the Moon
in Tibet
in Nepal
in Moscow
in St Petersburg
in London
in the London underground
by a Ferris Wheel in rural France
in a cavern underground
in Berlin
in the forest
floating aimlessly
in interstellar space
in low Earth orbit
in Mars orbit
on the surface of Venus
in a basement
on the London Bridge
in Siberia
in Hong Kong
in Tokyo
in some mysterious shop connected to the Astral Planes
on some stretch of road in the middle of nowhere
by the Eiffel tower
in a supermarket
in a physics laboratory
on a beautiful cliff
inside the Large Hadron Collider
by an unknown lake
in a mysterious town
in a large building of unknown size
on a collision course with the Moon
flying aimlessly in the Stratosphere
on the beachside in Florida
flying in a straight path over the Mediterranean Sea
in a chaotic wasteland
inside an uninhabited city
in Manhattan
hiding in a hole in the ground
in a closet
in Cambridge
in Valhalla
floating in the ocean
levitating over farmland
in a cornfield
somewhere over France
underneath a table
under a bed
in Mombasa
in a cave
orbiting an office building
on an unknown planet with a green/violet tint
in the Twilight Zone
in the twilight forests
in the Midnight Zone
inside a large, hollow cube
in the old cheese vault
in a crater on Mars
in a shoe
in a whale's mouth
in a reptile room
in an aquarium
in a skeleton's closet
in the Paris Catacombs
in a sanctum of unknown location
in the fires of unknown origin
in a polar orbit around a small moon
in a garden
in a supermarket
in an alternate reality
connected to a machine of sorts
in a tower in the woods
in a storage unit
in a hedge maze
in a seemingly burned down forest
in a dying forest
in the desert
in orbit of Polaris
in a screaming Void
in a hellish wasteland
in a barren landscape
by the cat down the road
in the outskirts of Las Vegas
by the side of the road
on some rural country roads
in grassland somewhere in North America
in a sacred temple
in Northeast Romania
in Kazakhstan
in a crop field
in a clearing
in some tall grass
in a garden
in a pale forest
in Thailand
in an Emerald city
in a bunker
in a bus
wrapped in a towel
in your pocket
in a... nevermind, you lost it, good job
in a pineapple under the sea
in a jar of mayo
in the cockpit of a plane
in a haystack
in hell
in heaven
